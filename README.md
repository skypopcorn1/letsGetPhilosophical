Let's Get Philosophical is a portfolio project from a full stack web development \n I took on Codecademy. The objective for the project was to create a simple Javascript application that can be run using Node to print out a message to the user. This portfolio project reinforced key pieces of curriculum including code repository management with GitHub, development project management and portfolio best practices.

This program utilises basic concepts in JS such as Arrays, Functions, String Concatenation and accessing the MATH object to randomly select from an array.

### Technologies
1. Javascript
2. Node

### Launch
The program is intended to be launch from the CLI using Node. Navigate to the folder containing the index.js file then execute the command below in the command line:

```
node index.js
```

Enjoy!
